This is an OPTIONAL assignment.  First solution
will be graded out of 10.  Each additional solution:
1 point. 

<H3>a. Removing duplicates</H3>
Given an array of unsorted objects of some class (that implements hashCode and equals), move the distinct elements of the array to the front.  The function behaves as follows.  Let k be the number of distinct elements of A (k is not known).  Find the k distinct elements of arr[], and move them to arr[0..k-1].  Return k.  Use hashing to implement the algorithm in expected O(n) time.  Signature: 
public static<T> int findDistinct(T[] arr)

<H3>b. Find the most frequently appearing element</H3>
Write a function that takes as parameter an array of integers, and returns an integer that is most frequent in the array.  Signature: public static int mostFrequent(int[] arr).
Compare the performance of an O(nlogn) algorithm that sorts the array with Arrays.sort and then finds the element, with a solution using HashMap that runs in O(n) expected time.

<H3>c-f. Comparison of hashing algorithms</H3>
Compare performance of Java's hash tables (HashSet/HashMap in Java's library) with any of the advanced hashing algorithms from class: 2-Choice, Cuckoo, Hopscotch, Robin Hood.  Each will be considered as a separate problem for grading purposes.  Use an overflow table (implemented with Java's hash map/set), if needed.
