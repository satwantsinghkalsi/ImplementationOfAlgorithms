Due: 1:00 PM, Thu, Apr 14.
</PRE>

Solve at least one problem from the following list.  First solution
will be graded out of 10.  Each additional problem will be considered
for 1 extra point.

<H3>a. Permutations and combinations</H3>
Implement the following algorithms discussed in class:
(a) Combination(A, n, k), (b) Permute(A, n).  
For Permute(), implement Take 2 and Heap's algorithms, and compare their running times for n = 8..14.

<H3>b. nPk</H3>
Combine the solutions to part a to get
Permute(A, n, k): ordered sets of cardinality k from a set of size n.

<H3>c. Knuth's L algorithm</H3>
Implement Knuth's algorithm for generating permutations in lexicographic order.

<H3>d. Enumeration of topological orders in DAGs</H3>
Given a DAG as input (use input format used by readGraph),
visit and print all topological orders of the graph.
